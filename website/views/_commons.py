    Explanation: shouldn't we look for refseq with gene name only?

    Well, we have to look for all isoforms of given gene which
    cover given mutation - so those with length Y: X <= Y, where
    X is the position (pos) of analysed mutation.

    There is on more constraint: some proteomic mutations cannot
    be caused by a single genomic mutations: F => S cannot be a
    result of a single SNV/SNP because neither UUU nor UUC could be
    changed to AGU or AGC in a single step.

    There are many such isoforms and simple lookup:
        gene_name => preferred_isoform, or
        gene_name => all_isoforms
    is not enough to satisfy all conditions.

    So what do we have here is (roughly) an equivalent to:

        from models import Gene

        # the function below should check if we don't have symbols
        # that are not representing any of known amino acids.

        is_mut_allowed(alt)

        # function above and below were not implemented but lets
        # assume that they throw a flow-changing exception
