        <name>Lepirudin</name>
        <description>Lepirudin is identical to natural hirudin except for substitution of leucine for isoleucine at the N-terminal end of the molecule and the absence of a sulfate group on the tyrosine at position 63. It is produced via yeast cells. Bayer ceased the production of lepirudin (Refludan) effective May 31, 2012.</description>

        <indication>For the treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</indication>
        <pharmacodynamics>Lepirudin is used to break up clots and to reduce thrombocytopenia. It binds to thrombin and prevents thrombus or clot formation. It is a highly potent, selective, and essentially irreversible inhibitor of thrombin and clot-bond thrombin. Lepirudin requires no cofactor for its anticoagulant action. Lepirudin is a recombinant form of hirudin, an endogenous anticoagulant found in medicinal leeches.</pharmacodynamics>
        <mechanism-of-action>Lepirudin forms a stable non-covalent complex with alpha-thrombin, thereby abolishing its ability to cleave fibrinogen and initiate the clotting cascade. The inhibition of thrombin prevents the blood clotting cascade. </mechanism-of-action>
        <toxicity>In case of overdose (eg, suggested by excessively high aPTT values) the risk of bleeding is increased.</toxicity>
        <metabolism>Lepirudin is thought to be metabolized by release of amino acids via catabolic hydrolysis of the parent drug. However, con-clusive data are not available. About 48% of the administration dose is excreted in the urine which consists of unchanged drug (35%) and other fragments of the parent drug.</metabolism>

        <name>Cetuximab</name>
        <description>Cetuximab is an epidermal growth factor receptor binding FAB. Cetuximab is composed of the Fv (variable; antigen-binding) regions of the 225 murine EGFr monoclonal antibody specific for the N-terminal portion of human EGFr with human IgG1 heavy and kappa light chain constant (framework) regions. Cetuximab is marketed under the brand Erbitux® by Eli Lilly and Company. In the United States, a regimen of cetuximab costs approximately $30,790 for an eight-week course.</description>

        <indication>Cetuximab, used in combination with irinotecan, is indicated for the treatment of EGFR-expressing, metastatic colorectal carcinoma in patients who are refractory to irinotecan-based chemotherapy. Cetuximab administered as a single agent is indicated for the treatment of EGFR-expressing, metastatic colorectal carcinoma in patients who are intolerant to irinotecan-based chemotherapy.</indication>
        <pharmacodynamics>Used in the treatment of colorectal cancer, cetuximab binds specifically to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr, HER1, c-ErbB-1) on both normal and tumor cells. EGFr is over-expressed in many colorectal cancers. Cetuximab competitively inhibits the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and other ligands, such as transforming growth factor–alpha. Binding of cetuximab to the EGFr blocks phosphorylation and activation of receptor-associated kinases, resulting in inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis, decreased matrix metalloproteinase secretion and reduced vascular endothelial growth factor production.</pharmacodynamics>
        <mechanism-of-action>Cetuximab binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr) on both normal and tumor cells. EGFr is over-expressed in many colorectal cancers. Cetuximab competitively inhibits the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and TGF alpha, thereby reducing their effects on cell growth and metastatic spread.</mechanism-of-action>
        <toxicity>Pulmonary Toxicity&#13;
            &#13;
            Interstitial lung disease (ILD) was reported in 3 of 633 (&lt;0.5%) patients with advanced colorectal cancer receiving cetuximab. Interstitial pneumonitis with non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema resulting in death was reported in one case. Two patients had pre-existing fibrotic lung disease and experienced an acute exacerbation of their disease while receiving cetuximab in combination with irinotecan. In the clinical investigational program, an additional case of interstitial pneumonitis was reported in a patient with head and neck cancer treated with cetuximab and cisplatin. The onset of symptoms occurred between the fourth and eleventh doses of treatment in all reported cases.</toxicity>

Known ligands include EGF, TGFA/TGF-alpha, amphiregulin, epigen/EPGN, BTC/betacellulin, epiregulin/EREG and HBEGF/heparin-binding EGF. Ligand binding triggers receptor homo- and/or heterodimerization and autophosphorylation on key cytoplasmic residues. The phosphorylated receptor recruits adapter proteins like GRB2 which in turn activates complex downstream signaling cascades. Activates at least 4 major downstream signaling cascades including the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK, PI3 kinase-AKT, PLCgamma-PKC and STATs modules. May also activate the NF-kappa-B signaling cascade. Also directly phosphorylates other proteins like RGS16, activating its GTPase activity and probably coupling the EGF receptor signaling to the G protein-coupled receptor signaling. Also phosphorylates MUC1 and increases its interaction with SRC and CTNNB1/beta-catenin.Isoform 2 may act as an antagonist of EGF action.</specific-function>

        <name>Dornase alfa</name>
        <description>Dornase alfa is a biosynthetic form of human deoxyribunuclease I (DNase I) enzyme. It is produced in genetically modified Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using recombinant DNA technology. The 260-amino acid sequence of dornase alfa is identical to the endogenous human enzyme. Dornase alfa cleaves extracellular DNA to 5´-phosphodinucleotide and 5´-phosphooligonucleotide end products without affecting intracellular DNA. In individuals with cystic fibrosis, extracellular DNA, which is an extremely viscous anion, is released by degenerating leukocytes that accumulate during inflammatory responses to infections. Enzymatic breakdown of this extracellular DNA appears to reduce sputum viscosity and viscoelasticity.</description>

        <indication>Used as adjunct therapy in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. </indication>
        <pharmacodynamics>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease characterized by the retention of viscous purulent secretions in the airways. These thick secretions contribute both to reduced pulmonary function and to frequent pulmonary infection. Purulent pulmonary secretions of individuals with cystic fibrosis contain very high concentrations of extracellular DNA released by degenerating leukocytes that accumulate in response to these infections. Dornase alfa hydrolyzes the DNA in sputum of CF patients and reduces sputum viscosity and viscoelasticity. The enzyme does not appear to affect sputum in the absence of an inflammatory response to infection, nor does it affect the sputum of healthy individuals. </pharmacodynamics>
        <mechanism-of-action>Dornase alfa is a biosynthetic form of human DNase I. The enzyme is involved in endonucleolytic cleavage of extracellular DNA to 5´-phosphodinucleotide and 5´-phosphooligonucleotide end products. It has no effect on intracellular DNA. Optimal activity is dependent on the presence of divalent cations such as calcium and magnesium. Extracellular DNA is a viscous anionic polymer and its breakdown appears to improve the viscosity and viscoelasticity of purulent sputum of individuals with CF, thus reducing airflow obstruction. Dornase alfa does not seem to have any effect on non-purulent sputum.</mechanism-of-action>
        <toxicity>Adverse reactions occur at a frequency of &lt; 1/1000 and are usually mild and transient in nature. Reported adverse effects include chest pain (pleuritic/non-cardiac), fever, dyspepsia, voice alteration (hoarseness), pharyngitis, dyspnea, laryngitis, rhinitis, decreased lung function, rash, urticaria, and conjunctivitis. There is no evidence of carcinogenic or mutagenic properties. The safety of dornase alfa has not been studied in pregnant women, nursing women and children under the age of 5 years old. </toxicity>
        <metabolism>While no conclusive studies have yet been published, dornase alfa is expected to be metabolized by proteases in biofluids. </metabolism>
        <absorption>Studies in rats and monkeys after inhalation of dornase alfa shows very little systemic absorption (less than 15% for rats and less than 2% for monkeys). The results were also witnessed in patients. Dornase alfa is also associated with very low accumulation with no serum concentration greater than 10ng/mL observed no matter the dose administered. Bioavailability: mean sputum concentrations of dornase alfa can be measured after 15 minutes. Onset is achieved within 3 to 7 days. Peak concentrations are achieved after 9 days.</absorption>

      <name>Etanercept</name>
      <description>Dimeric fusion protein consisting of the extracellular ligand-binding portion of the human 75 kilodalton (p75) tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1. The Fc component of etanercept contains the CH2 domain, the CH3 domain and hinge region, but not the CH1 domain of IgG1. Etanercept is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mammalian cell expression system. It consists of 934 amino acids.</description>

      <indication>Etanercept is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis in adults and chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. It is also used to manage signs and symptoms of polyarticular idiopathic arthritis in those aged 4 to 17 after insufficient response to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. Etanercept is also used to improve psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. </indication>
      <pharmacodynamics>Etanercept binds specifically to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and thereby modulates biological processes that are induced or regulated by TNF. Such processes or molecules affected include the level of adhesion molecules expressed, as well as serum levels of cytokines and matrix metalloproteinase-3, also known as stromelysin. In animal models, etanarcept has been demonstrated to affect inflammation, such as in murine collagen-induced arthritis.</pharmacodynamics>
      <mechanism-of-action>There are two distinct receptors for TNF (TNFRs), a 55 kilodalton protein (p55) and a 75 kilodalton protein (p75). The biological activity of TNF is dependent upon binding to either cell surface receptor (p75 or p55). Etanercept is a dimeric soluble form of the p75 TNF receptor that can bind to two TNF molecules, thereby effectively removing them from circulation.&#13;
    &#13;
    TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Increased levels of TNF are found in tissues and fluids of those with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and plaque psoriasis. </mechanism-of-action>
